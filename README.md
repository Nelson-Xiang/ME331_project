# ME331_project

This is my final project of the course ME331: Modeling and Control of Robot at Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech). In this project, we mainly focus on trajectory tracking of the 3-DoF parallel delta robot. Basically, we use 5-order polynomial to conduct trajectory planning, and we apply for different controlling strategies for the trajectory tracking.
